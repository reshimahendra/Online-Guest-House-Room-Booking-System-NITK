## Abstract

### Objective
The objective of the project is to build a web application for guest house
booking system in NITK. This system allows students of NITK to book
rooms in guest house in advance for their parents and relatives. This
website provides information about rooms availability, checkin, checkout
details etc.
As of now there is no online facility for advance booking of Guest house
rooms in NITK. So, we are developing a website which allows students to
book rooms in advance directly through website.
The system allows only NITK students to book the rooms in advance. This
will be done by confirming the students using the institute email address
(​ xxxx@nitk.edu.in​ ) and other required credentials.
### Frameworks
● Database: SQLite3
● Web Development: Django
This system helps the student by reducing the burden of physically booking
rooms at Guest House, taking permission from Registar etc. As the system itself
makes sure that the rooms are booked by NITK students only, there is no need
of confirming the authenticity of students.

## Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to serve students of NITK to help them book rooms of
guest house in NITK. There are in total three guest houses present in NITK. The
present system of booking involves physical presence of students to book rooms and
take permission from Registar and present the copy of permission to staff of the guest
house. This causes burden on students. In order to solve this issue we come up with a
website which allows students to book rooms online by authenticating that they belong
to NITK via xxxx@nitk.edu.in account.


### 1.2 Objective
In this world of growing technologies everything can be digitized. With a higher
efficiency, digitized systems are always preferred options. We are living at a time when
digitization of room bookings has never been this big. Thus, there is a need for a system
which can help students of NITK to book rooms of guest house online. This is where our
project comes in.
